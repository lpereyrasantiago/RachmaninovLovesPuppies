# RachmaninovLovesPuppies
Twitter bot that updates twitter status with puppies' pictures. Can be used with or without PuppyAdopter. It was thought as a useful tool to give PuppyAdopter, a program that downloads images of puppies and other baby animals, a practical use and purpose. 

Why Rachmaninov? He's was the only picture I had downloaded on my PC when created the twitter bot; 'why not', I figured.

Is this a work in progress? Yes. Though functional, perhaps I'll add things in the near future.

Why share the script? Because with really minor changes it can do lots of other things. So that's up to anybody. Also because is extremely simple and anyone could tweak it in its own advantage or taste.
